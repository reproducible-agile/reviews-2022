summary: |
    The paper evaluates the competence of selected features in the prediction of Nitrogen Dioxide with Machine Learning.
    For this reproduciblity review, the Figures and Tables of "Section 5 - Experiments and Results" were considered, while the Figures of "Section 3 - Exploratory Analysis"" were not.
    The code of the corresponding analysis was provided as a GitHub repository and the data that is necessary to run the code were provided through a Zenodo repository.
    The reproduced results were in accordance with the ones reported in the paper, so the reproduction of the paper is considered successful.

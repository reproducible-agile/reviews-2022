summary: |
    The paper provides a link to a GitHub repository that was initially difficult to use but was promptly improved by the authors after an email exchange.
    The repository contains only one out of two datasets presented in the paper but most results based on this dataset have been successfully reproduced with minor disparities due to automated scaling of graphs.
    In sum, the manuscript has been partially reproduced.
    The repository is well-documented, it includes the documentation of required software versions, and the authorsâ€™ response to questions and bugs has been prompt and helpful.

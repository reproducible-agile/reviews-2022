summary: |
    The main contribution of the paper are two web applications on the streamlit.io platform.
    The paper includes the DASA section and links to live online instances of the applications, as well as to GitHub repositories with the code and data.  The repositories are well documented.
    I was able to clone the repositories and run the code, reproducing examples demonstrated on figures in the paper.
    One of the reproduced figures differed from the one presented in the paper. 
    The tables demonstrating results of the evaluation of the app were partially reproducible but returned slightly different values.
    The paper has been partially reproduced.

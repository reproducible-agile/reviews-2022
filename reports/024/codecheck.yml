summary: |
    The code and data provided by the authors allow to partially reproduce the computational work presented in the Section 4.4 of the paper. The model training (PointNet++) and the input data for Section 4.4 are not reproducible with the provided code but the authors added a note, in the GitHub repository of their project, explaining how the data was generated. Three figures in Section 4.4 are fully reproducible (5, 6, and 7), 2 partially (4 and 8) and 4 are not (3, 9, 10, and 11).

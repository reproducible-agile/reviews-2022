summary: |
    The paper compares several models for traffic control recognition at junctions, which are built upon Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
    The analysis makes use of 2 datasets, which correspond to the cities of Chicago and Hannover.
    The authors agreed to share confidentially all their materials (data and code) with the Reproducibility Committee for the needs of the review.
    For the needs of this review, we reproduced all the Tables and Figures of 'Section 5 - Results' and of the Appendix.
    The reproduced results were in accordance with the final uploaded version of the manuscript.
    Therefore, the reproduction of the paper is considered successful.
